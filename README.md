### Bookraid

Nifty [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) program to get books in the fiction category from Libgen. I use it to try out books or find copies of certain editions I can't find for sale anywhere. Please, please support authors by purchasing books from them directly!

#### Usage

Add a `.env` file with the base Libgen URL as `BASE_URL`, base Libgen download URL as `BASE_DL_URL` and a download path as `DL_PATH`. Run the program. Alternatively, use the binary and set the download path manually.
